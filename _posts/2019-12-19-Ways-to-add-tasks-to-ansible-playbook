Going through official website for beginner is somehow difficult and confused, since ansible provides a few slightly different ways to add tasks to
playbook. As a software developer, I always think this is not make users's world better, in contrast, which makes it hard to work. 
My opinion is that 
```
Giving a unique interface will make users much more easier than giving freedom to do the same thing in a few ways.
```

In this post, I'm summerizing 3 ways of adding tasks to ansible book. I do recommand that u shouldn't mix them too much. 

1. Tasks
1.1 Use tasks with key-values
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
  - name: make sure apache is running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
```
1.2 Use tasks with module argument lists
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
  - name: run this command and ignore the result
    shell: /usr/bin/somecommand || /bin/true
```
1.3 Use tasks with import_tasks
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
  - name: run this command and ignore the result
    import_tasks: sometask.yaml
```
// The command and shell modules are the only modules that just take a list of arguments and donâ€™t use the key=value form

2. Roles
2.1 Use roles with simple name
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - common
```
2.2 Use roles with full key-values
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
  - role: common
    vars:
       dir: '/opt/a'
```
In 2.2, we add the key - role explicitly.

3. Task Role (Ansible 2.4)
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:  // Here is tasks, not roles compared to section 2
  - import_role:
      name: example
  - include_role:
      name: example
    vars:
      dir: '/opt/a'
```

4. Import a whole playbook 
```
---
- name: Include a play after another play // here is top level of playbook
  import_playbook: otherplays.yaml 

//otherplays.yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    ...
```
