I use to document things in google docs, one is called engineering handbook and the other named programming handbook.
I think I need to publish and share my ideas and experiences so that someone can find it and solve their problem. And also learn some 
experiences from others.

You'll find out a lot of topics in this website since I'm working as Developer, DevOps and fullstack CTO of [Foodla AB](http://foodla.nu)
