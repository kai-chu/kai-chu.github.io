I used to document things in two google docs, one of them is called engineering handbook and the other is programming handbook.
I think I need to share my ideas and experiences so that someone can find it and solve their problems. And also I need to learn some experiences from others.

You'll find out a lot of topics in this website since I'm working as Developer, DevOps and fullstack CTO of [Foodla AB](http://foodla.nu)
