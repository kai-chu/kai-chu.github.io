I'm not trying to become a developer, but to be an engineer. 

> I graduated with double master degrees, one is in software engineering from [HIT](http://en.hit.edu.cn) in China and the other is in computer science from [Liu](https://liu.se) in Sweden.

> I worked as Java developer in a fintech company for 3 years since I graduated. We are providing Foreign Exchange System for banks around the world. I got a lot interests in DevOps during that time. I learnt to think as a software architect, to build and maintain CI/CD pipelines and also to drink beers. 

> I'm a Senior Developer and DevOps in Inovia AB now. We are focusing on big data and AI solutions. As a DevOps, I collected suggestions from different microservices development teams and defined git way of working so that we can reduce the complexity of product build and release. I propose a way to manage different customer, environment configuration management and scripting it. I'm trying automate microservices delivery and deployment to make sure quick feedback and smooth deployment. As a big data developer, I'm working in a team to help a customer to create their data lake. 

> I'm co-founder of Foodla AB, as a CTO, I proposed intial platform archtecture and implemented the platform with Reactjs, Nodejs with GraphQL backend api schema definition. I built CI/CD pipelin in GCP, google cloud build from Github, push docker image into cloud registry, deploy it into kubernetes. I also managed to lead an intern to work in the team. Coordinate with CEO, analysis requirements, break them into measurable tasks, managing sprint in github project Kanban board and review codes.

> In my spare time, I play pingpong, tennis and I'm good at badminton. I like to fish with my friends even though I haven't succeeded to catch one yet.
