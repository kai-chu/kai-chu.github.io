Vars can exist in many places

1. Defined in ansible playbook level
- hosts: all
  vars:
    varName: value
  vars_files:
    - vars/dags.yml
  tasks:
    - name: Push dags to remote 
  
1.1 Create a var file
Clear text can be created by vi or any text editor
1.2 Encrypted var file which is called vault file
ansible-vault create foo.yml

# The vars defined in special folder
The `ansible-playbook` command looks for these directories in the current working directory by default
```
playbook
- host_vars
  - host_name.yaml, yml, json
  - host_name_folder
    - all files will be read in lexicographical order
- group_vars
  - main.yml, will be read by all hosts
  - group_name.yaml, yml, json
  - host_name_folder
    - all files will be read in lexicographical order
inventories
- production
  - group_vars
    - all.yml
    
The `ansible` and `ansible-console` commands look for directories in the inventory. 
Provide `--playbook-dir` to make them load vars from playbook directory and those in playbook will override the ones in inventory
inventory
- host_vars
  - host_name.yaml, yml, json
  - host_name_folder
    - all files will be read in lexicographical order
- group_vars
  - group_name.yaml, yml, json
  - host_name_folder
    - all files will be read in lexicographical order
```


--extra-vars @filename in cli
ansible-playbook --extra-vars @profiles/kai/all.yml playbook.yml
inventory
- profiles
  - kai
    - all.yml
- playbook.yml
