Data model
Information model is based on entries
- entries, an entry is a collection of attributes that has a globally-unique Distinguished Name (DN)
  - attribute, an attribute has a type and one or more values. 
    - type, mnemonic strings, like "cn" for common name, or "mail" for email address. 
    - To control which attributes are required and allowed, use a special attribute called objectClass. The values of the objectClass attribute determine the schema rules the entry must obey

Storage data structure
In LDAP, directory entries are arranged in a hierarchical tree-like structure

Operations
Operations are provided for adding and deleting an entry from the directory, changing an existing entry, and changing the name of an entry.
