# Hosted hypervisors
It is an application(also called guest os) running on top of another os(named host os), it runs as a process on the host.
It's kind of os software to emulate other system commands and translate them into host os commands. (No hardware involved)
QUME is type1 hypervisor 


# Native Hypervisor
Also called native or bare-metal hypervisor, controls the hardware in os kernel level.  
KVM is type1 hypervisor, it requires a processor with hardware virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT or AMD-V, to help to translate or map instructions to hardware cpu
