# Hosted hypervisors
It is an application(also called guest os) running on top of another os(named host os), it runs as a process on the host.
It's kind of os software to emulate other system commands and translate them into host os commands. (No hardware involved)
QUME is type1 hypervisor 


# Native Hypervisor
Also called native or bare-metal hypervisor, controls the hardware in os kernel level.  
KVM is type1 hypervisor, it requires a processor with hardware virtualization extensions, such as Intel VT or AMD-V, to help to translate or map instructions to hardware cpu


KVM is a type 1 hypervisor and Qemu is a Type 2 hypervisor. Type 1 hypervisor comes installed with the hardware system like KVM in Linux. KVM provides hardware acceleration for virtual machines but it need Qemu to emulate any operating system.
Qemu is a Type 2 hypverisor, it can be installed on an operating system and it runs as an indepent process and the instructions we give in Quemu will be executed on the host machine. Qemu can run independently without KVM as its a emulator however the performance will be poor as Qemu doesnt do any hardware acceleration
There is a project that is on-going to integrate Qemu and KVM. This will be a type 1 hypervisor. So we will have all the benefits of Qemu as an emulator and KVM hardware acceleration for better performance.
