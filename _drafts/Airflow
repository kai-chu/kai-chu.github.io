1. What is airflow
Airflow is an 
2. Quick run
3. Archtecture
Executor
Dag
Directed Acyclic Graph – is a workflow of all the tasks you want to run, organized in a way that reflects their relationships and dependencies In general, each one should correspond to a single logical workflow
Dagbag
- default dags
-- /usr/local/airflow/dags
Task
A work unit in a DAG, it is an implementation of an Operator. for example a PythonOperator to execute some Python code, or a BashOperator to run a Bash command
Task instance
A runtime exection of a task, It should be a combination of a DAG, a task, and a point in time (execution_date)
Job
UI
command line tools
webserver 
scheduler
Sqlite

Dag folder
A folder where airflow is searching DAG definition python files, execute and build DAG objects into airflow system. 
When searching for DAGs, Airflow only considers python files that contain the strings “airflow” and “DAG” by default. 
To consider all python files instead, disable the DAG_DISCOVERY_SAFE_MODE configuration flag.

Dag definition
Airflow use python file to declare dag objects, a DAG function is provided to accept configurations. e.g. dag=DAG('dag_name', default_args=default_args)
Dag arguments
The arguments provided for the dag object when the dag is run
Dag default arguments
The default dag argument, which is provided when defining the dag in dag definition python file

Context manager
airflow will find a dag definition in a python and assign that dat to operators defined in that definition file

Dag objects build
Airflow will find and run dag definition python files to create dags

Task relationship
Tasks a a dag can has dependencies by using task_1 >> task_2
Upstream
if we have a taskA, then the task running before it is the upstream of taskA, task A need to wait until upstream has completed successfully.
Downsteam
if we have a taskA, then the task after it is the downstream of taskA

Task lifecycle
A task goes through various stages from start to completion
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/_images/task_lifecycle_diagram.png

Operators
Operators is specific implementations of tasks. It defines what the task does and are only loaded by Airflow if they are assigned to a DAG.
BashOperator - executes a bash command
PythonOperator - calls an arbitrary Python function
EmailOperator - sends an email
SimpleHttpOperator - sends an HTTP request

Bitshift Composition
A convinient way to define relationships between tasks.

Pool
A named of list of workers which can be refered by a task to manually balance airflow workload.

Queue
Queue for a executor to cache tasks

Worker
Processes to get tasks out from queue and run it, workers can listen to one or multiple queues of tasks.

    backfill            Run subsections of a DAG for a specified date range.
                        If reset_dag_run option is used, backfill will first
                        prompt users whether airflow should clear all the
                        previous dag_run and task_instances within the
                        backfill date range. If rerun_failed_tasks is used,
                        backfill will auto re-run the previous failed task
                        instances within the backfill date range.
    list_dag_runs       List dag runs given a DAG id. If state option is
