A way to commnicate between operators

Set xcom variables in task_instance context by
1. xcom_push
2. return value from operator execute()
3. return value from python_callable 

Get xcom varaibles from context by 
1. xcom_pull
- If xcom_pull is passed a single string for task_ids, then the most recent XCom value from that task is returned; 
  if a list of task_ids is passed, then a corresponding list of XCom values is returned.
2. from jinja template {{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='foo', key='table_name') }}
