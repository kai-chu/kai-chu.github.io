ssh-keyscan -H $host >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
sshpass -p $password ssh $host

Use sshpass:

sshpass -p "password" scp -r user@example.com:/some/remote/path /some/local/path
or so the password does not show in the bash history

sshpass -f "/path/to/passwordfile" scp -r user@example.com:/some/remote/path /some/local/path
The above copies contents of path from the remote host to your local.

Install :

ubuntu/debian
apt install sshpass
centos/fedora
yum install sshpass
mac w/ macports
port install sshpass
mac w/ brew
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kadwanev/bigboybrew/master/Library/Formula/sshpass.rb
