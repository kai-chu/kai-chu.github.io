import re

To use re a pre compiled obj
Compiled pattern, . The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression
matchObj = re.compile('expression')

Use match object to match a string
matches = matchObj.match('string')

Access matched groups 
matches.group(1)


To use re directly
re.match(pattern, str, mode)

line = "Cats are smarter than dogs"
matchObj = re.match( r'(.*) are (.*?) .*', line, re.M|re.I)

Modifiers

re.I
Performs case-insensitive matching.
2
re.L
Interprets words according to the current locale. This interpretation affects the alphabetic group (\w and \W), as well as word boundary behavior(\b and \B).
3
re.M
Makes $ match the end of a line (not just the end of the string) and makes ^ match the start of any line (not just the start of the string).
4
re.S
Makes a period (dot) match any character, including a newline.
5
re.U
Interprets letters according to the Unicode character set. This flag affects the behavior of \w, \W, \b, \B.
6
re.X
Permits "cuter" regular expression syntax. It ignores whitespace (except inside a set [] or when escaped by a backslash) and treats unescaped # as a comment marker.
