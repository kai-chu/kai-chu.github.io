Boolean value
By default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a __bool__() method that returns False or a __len__() method that returns zero, when called with the object. 1 Here are most of the built-in objects considered false:
constants defined to be false: None and False.

zero of any numeric type: 0, 0.0, 0j, Decimal(0), Fraction(0, 1)

empty sequences and collections: '', (), [], {}, set(), range(0)

Operations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated. (Important exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return one of their operands.)
