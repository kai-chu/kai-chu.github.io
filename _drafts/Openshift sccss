Security Context Constraints
Official definition: control the actions that a pod can perform and what it has the ability to access.

Explaination:
It's not the pod to be restricted, it is a dedicated service account which is associated with the pod. 
By default, there are 3 service accounts created by openshift, 
* builder, to manage images
* default, default service account for any object created 
* deployer, deploy pods
all pod use the default service account in the namespace. 
```
oc get serviceaccount
```

1. A user/serviceaccount can access resource list
2. A user/serviceaccount can take action list
