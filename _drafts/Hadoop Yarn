Apache hadoop YARN(Yet Another Resource Negotiator), one of the core components in Apache hadoop, as a resource manager and job scheduler. It allocates and monitor system resources(cpu, memeory, network, disk) in 
in the hadoop cluster.
>> It's commonly referred to by the acronym alone; the full name was self-deprecating humor on the part of its developers

Apache hadoop 1.0 is HDFS with MapReduce framework, to provide a distributed compute cluster scaling up on cheap hardwares. 
Developers can create applications based on the MapReduce framework and deployed it into the Hadoop cluster to utilize distribution computes. 
MapReduce framework in Hadoop 1.0 implements Google MR algorithm as well as distributed tracker system which consists of JobTracker and TaskTracker. 
JobTrack run in master node to split an task into independent units and assign task to taskTrack in each node.

Apache hadoop 2.0 improves limitions of v1.0, add extract JobTracker and TaskTracker from MapReduce implementation in V1.0. 
Yarn has ResourceManager running in master and NodeManager running in node.
`
The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system. 
The NodeManager is the per-machine framework agent who is responsible for containers, monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the ResourceManager/Scheduler.

ResourceManager
Scheduler, allocating resources based on the abstract notion of a resource Container which incorporates elements such as memory, cpu, disk, network et
ApplicationsManager, accepting jobs, exposing services to restart application master. 
- The per-application ApplicationMaster has the responsibility of negotiating appropriate resource containers from the Scheduler, tracking their status and monitoring for progress.
 a) communicating with the ResourceManager to negotiate and allocate resources for future containers
 b) after container allocation, communicating YARN NodeManagers (NMs) to launch application containers on them. Task a) can be performed asynchronously through an AMRMClientAsync object, with event handling methods specified in a
