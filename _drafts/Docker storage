To decide where docker container or services are storaging files

Types:
1. bind mount
2. volume
3. tmpfs mount


1. Bind mount
Maping an absolute path
- docker and host can change files

  Use case
  - Sharing files from the host machine to container, config, build artifacts
  - Host file structure is guranteed to be consistent with docker
2. volume
docker manages volumes in /var/lib/docker/volumes/VOLUME_NAME
- only docker can change
  Multiple containers mount. 
  Not removed automatically. Manually remove with docker volume prune.
  Named or anonymous
  Volume drivers 
  Use case
  - read-write or read-only
  - Sharing data among multiple running containers,  a volume is created the first time it is mounted into a container
  - remote strorage instead of locally
  - back data by creating container from volume
3. tmpfs mount
mounts are stored in the host system’s memory only, and are never written to the host system’s filesystem.
- docker can change 
  Use case 
  tmpfs mounts are best used for cases when you do not want the data to persist either on the host machine or within the container. This may be for security reasons or to protect the performance of the container when your application needs to write a large volume of non-persistent state data.
4. named pipes
An npipe mount can be used for communication between the Docker host and a container. 

Empty volume files or directories will be added by container
Bind mount or non-empty volume are obscured by the mount container
