1. Tasks
1.1 Use tasks with key-values
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
  - name: make sure apache is running
    service:
      name: httpd
      state: started
```
1.2 Use tasks with module argument lists
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
  - name: run this command and ignore the result
    shell: /usr/bin/somecommand || /bin/true
```
// The command and shell modules are the only modules that just take a list of arguments and donâ€™t use the key=value form

2. Roles
2.1 Use roles with simple name
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
    - common
2.2 Use roles with full key-values
---
- hosts: webservers
  roles:
  - role: common
    vars:
       dir: '/opt/a'
2.3 Use roles with include_role
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
  - include_role:
      name: common
    vars:
      dir: '/opt/a'

3. Task Role (Ansible 2.4)
```
---
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
  - import_role:
      name: example
  - include_role:
      name: example
```
