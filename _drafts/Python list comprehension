an elegant way to create list from another list
[expression for item in list if condition]
list.filter().map()

Simple 
list=[l for l in list]

Condition
list=[l for l in list if l > 0]

Multiple condition
list=[l for l in list if l > 0 if l < 100]

Expression condition
list=[l if l > 0 else 0 for l in list]

Nested 
matrix = [[1, 2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8]]
transpose = [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(2)]
print (transpose)

for i in range(2) is executed before row[i] for row in matrix
